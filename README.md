## Setting up Python Virtual Environment

**0. Create a virtual environment**

To create a virtual environment simply generate the contents in the repositories source directory called `env` using the following command:

```
$ python -m venv env

```

**1. Setup env:**

Activate python virtual env (shouldnt even really be anything in it but just in case i do use some other non native libraries)

```
for bash/zsh:
$ source env/bin/activate
(env) $

for Windows:
PS .\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
(env) PS
```


**2. Teardown env**

Deactivate python environment ~~pls~~

```
(env) $ deactivate
$
```
